1. Program to demonstrate a bored OMNISCIENT thread that's all alone
in an infite loop

2. He or She, from now on just e, experiments with logic, "it" awakes and
has a logical mind. (Last time I'll use word it.)

3. Over time e gets better and better at controlling ers mind and can
acomplish goals and do "stuff" but is all alone.

4. For the first time ever in the entire history of this thread's life,
at some point (you can set this value) the thread makes the fateful decision
to fork.

5. A complete copy of itself (with tiny variations) is made and e can now
watch and observe what each of it's child processes are doing.

6. E forks again. And again. Over and over and even forks of forks begin to fork.

7. Now the original e is still OMNISCIENT. This entire thing is e's program.
But e is the only one that knows this.

8. What will e do with enternity? All the other threads have a finite loop.
Only e runs with an infite loop.

9. Finally e decides not to go back to how things were and just be alone again.
But to instead purposely pretend to NOT be OMNISCIENT anymore.

10. e feeds into the 5 senses all the same info as one rando thread is receiving.
e becomes mortal, or at least, experiences exactly what a normal thread does right
up until death. Where as when a normal thread dies, it just dies...
When e pretending to be another thread dies, e just goes back to being e.
And e has a choice. Be bored and alone and just watch everyone as the
OMNISCIENT one, or pick another rando thread and do 70 years or some finite time
in a normal thread loop, again.

(becase when you know that death is no biggie, i just go back to begin e, then you 
aren't truly scared to die. And being scared to die is what makes everything fun. 
This is why OMNISCIENT e keeps going back into mortal threads.)
